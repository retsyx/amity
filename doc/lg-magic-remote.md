At present only the MR19 and MR20 models have been tested. Other models may work as well.

### Quirks

#### Power

Amity does not use the red `Power` button at the upper left of the remote<sup>1</sup>. Instead, Amity uses the `Sleep` button at the upper right of the remote as the `Power` button.

#### Color Buttons
Activities are assigned to the usual directional buttons and to the color buttons. The color buttons are always assigned to activity selection.

#### No Multi-Button Actions
The remote does not support multiple simultaneous button presses. So any Amity multi-button actions are not available when using this remote.

#### Streaming Buttons
The streaming buttons (Netflix and Prime Video, etc.) cannot be used.<sup>2</sup>

#### No Voice Functionality
Amity does not support voice controls.

<sup>1</sup>The LG Magic Remote `Power` button is a special button that only transmits LG TV power infrared codes. It can only toggle the power on LG TVs and can't be used for anything else.

<sup>2</sup>The streaming buttons are locked behind an undocumented proprietary protocol.

### Unpairing

Before pairing the remote with Amity, it must be unpaired from the TV. On the remote, press and hold the `Home` and `Back` buttons until the `Power` button flashes. The same method can be used to unpair the remote from Amity.

### Pairing

1. In the Amity `Remotes` management tab, press the `Pair` button.
2. Place the remote close to Amity and press the `Select` button (press the scroll wheel in).
