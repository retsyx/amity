### Quirks

#### Streaming Buttons
The streaming buttons (Netflix and Prime Video, etc.) cannot be used.<sup>1</sup>

#### No Voice Functionality
Amity does not support voice controls.

<sup>1</sup>The streaming buttons are locked behind an undocumented proprietary protocol.

### Unpairing

Before pairing the remote with Amity, it must be unpaired. On the remote, press and hold the `Home` button until an orange LED flashes (about 10 seconds). If nothing happens, release the button, and try again. The same method can be used to unpair the remote from Amity.

### Pairing

1. In the Amity `Remotes` management tab, press the `Pair` button.
2. Place the remote close to Amity and press the `Home` button.
