# Keyboards

Amity supports a few kinds of keyboards.

## BLE

Standard BLE (not older Bluetooth) keyboards can be paired like any supported remote.

### Pairing

1. In the Amity `Remotes` management tab, press the `Pair` button.
2. Place the keyboard close to Amity, and start the pairing process on the keyboard.

## Wireless Keyboards With USB Dongles

A Raspberry Pi with a USB port must be used to be able to plug in the dongle.

## RF Remotes With USB Dongles

Some RF remotes are functionally keyboards.

Many (if not most) generic RF remotes have an IR only `Power` button, rendering them **unusable** with Amity. If the `Power` button doesn't seem to be working, this is the reason.
