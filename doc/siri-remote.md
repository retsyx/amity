### Quirks

There are no directional buttons. To select an activity, press the touchpad (making a click) on the part of the touchpad that corresponds to the direction. Press the center for the first activity, towards the top of the touchpad for the second activity, towards the right for the third activity, and so on.

#### Power Button
There is no power button. Triple tap (not press) the touchpad to signal a `Power` button press.

Amity multi-button actions are not available when using this remote.
